I am a PhD student in the Health Sciences and Technology Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School, supervised by Professor [Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/) and Postdoctoral Fellow Dr. [Andrew Song](https://andrewsong90.github.io/). My current research focuses on 3D multimodal computational pathology and AI for Spatial Transcriptomics analysis.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a MSc in the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Zurich, and completed the Master Thesis in the Swiss Light Source (SLS) synchrotron, where I worked on AI tools for phase-contrast microCT images co-supervised by Professor [Marco Stampanoni](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.NTg3ODU=.TGlzdC8zMjc5LC0xNjUwNTg5ODIw.html) and Dr. [Goran Lovric](https://blog.gnudo.com/). During this time, I was lucky to be supported by La Caixa Spanish Excellence Fellowship. Before that, I completed my BSc in Biomedical Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and spent one year at Johns Hopkins University. The Bachelor Thesis was focused on 3D Computational Pathology for analysing the immune microenvironment of pancreatic cancer and I was co-supervised by Professors [Arrate Muñoz](https://image.hggm.es/es/arrate-munoz), [Denis Wirtz](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/denis-wirtz/), and [Ashley Kiemen](https://inbt.jhu.edu/people/ashley-kiemen/). While completing the BSc, I also graduated as a professional clarinetist.



<!-- Previously, I received a MSc. in Biomedical Engineering from ETH Zurich university in August 2023, with the master thesis focused on synchrotron-based phase-contrast microCT co-advised by Professor [Marco Stampanoni](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/people-a-z/person-detail.NTg3ODU=.TGlzdC8zMjc5LC0xNjUwNTg5ODIw.html) and Dr. [Goran Lovric](https://blog.gnudo.com/). In July 2021, I received a Bachelor also in Biomedical Engineering from Carlos III de Madrid University. The Bachelor thesis was focused on 3D computational pathology for analysing the immune microenvironment of pancreatic cancer and was a collaboration with Johns Hopkins University co-supervised by Professors [Arrate Muñoz](https://image.hggm.es/es/arrate-munoz), [Denis Wirtz](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/denis-wirtz/), and [Ashley Kiemen](https://inbt.jhu.edu/people/ashley-kiemen/). I also graduated as a professional clarinetist after 10 years of classical music education. -->
